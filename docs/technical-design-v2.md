# Version 2 Technical Audit

## Release objective

Turn the repaired Version 1 prototype into an offline, country-independent, large-backup-capable release suitable for updating the existing public GitHub repository.

## Implemented release decisions

1. **English-only interface and documentation**
2. **No CDN or runtime network dependencies**
3. **Exact dependency versions and redistributed licenses included**
4. **Explicit default-country onboarding instead of a hidden German assumption**
5. **Streaming XML parsing instead of `DOMParser`**
6. **IndexedDB storage instead of complete in-memory data storage**
7. **A maximum of 200 rendered messages at once**
8. **Progress and cancellation for long imports**
9. **Text-focused MMS support while skipping large media payloads**
10. **Release checklist, integrity manifest, and automated tests**

## Dependency and license status

Bundled production dependencies:

- Bootstrap 5.3.8 — MIT
- jsPDF 4.2.1 — MIT
- libphonenumber-js 1.13.9 — MIT, with Apache-2.0-licensed metadata derived from Google's libphonenumber project

Font Awesome was removed. Production files, complete license texts, exact versions, sizes, and SHA-256 hashes are documented in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `vendor/licenses/`, and `vendor/manifest.json`.

## Verification completed for this package

Verified on 26 July 2026:

- `npm test`: **19 passed, 0 failed**
- Streaming parser performance test: **100,000 records passed**
- Browser smoke test: **passed**
- JavaScript syntax checks: **passed**
- `npm audit`: **0 known vulnerabilities reported**
- Duplicate HTML IDs: **none**
- Missing JavaScript DOM references: **none**
- Duplicate function declarations: **none**
- Missing local production assets: **none**
- Remote production URLs: **none**
- Vendor manifest hash mismatches: **none**
- `eval()` usage: **none**
- Dynamic `innerHTML` assignments: **none**

The browser smoke test covers first-run country selection, streamed import, German local/international number merging, contact rendering, a conversation longer than 200 records, pagination/windowed rendering, full-conversation search, MMS text and attachment metadata, PDF generation with an emoji regression case, import completion, and the absence of external requests.

The project owner additionally verified a real 8 MB SMS Backup & Restore file containing 16,153 records from 413 contacts. Import, contact indexing, conversation viewing, and PDF creation completed successfully. The first real PDF test exposed a jsPDF standard-font surrogate-pair defect: an emoji could appear as text such as `Ø=P` and spread the surrounding line across the page. The PDF path now normalizes control characters, replaces emoji with `[emoji]`, replaces other unsupported glyphs with `?`, resets character spacing explicitly, wraps long tokens safely, and adds consistent margins and page footers. A rendered regression fixture confirms that the affected message text no longer fragments or clips.

## Large-backup architecture

Version 2 removes the original full-file `FileReader`/`DOMParser` path. The XML stream is tokenized incrementally and records are written to IndexedDB in batches. The complete backup is therefore not duplicated as one JavaScript string and one XML DOM tree.

The UI also avoids rendering entire long conversations. It loads at most 200 messages into the conversation window at a time. Contact rendering is limited to 500 results, with search available for narrowing large contact sets.

MMS `data` attributes can contain very large base64 values. Version 2 counts and skips those values while retaining MMS text and attachment metadata. This prevents media payloads from being copied into application memory and IndexedDB.

## Important limits that remain explicit

- Available IndexedDB quota is controlled by the browser, browser profile, device, and free disk space. No browser-only application can guarantee that an arbitrarily large multi-gigabyte text index will fit on every system.
- Direct `file://` use is less reliable than localhost or HTTPS for persistent storage and streaming file export.
- PDF export is intentionally limited to 5,000 messages.
- The direct jsPDF export deliberately substitutes emoji and unsupported scripts to keep its compact selectable-text PDF stable. Exact emoji and non-Latin glyphs remain available through browser printing of the current 200-message page.
- MMS media is not decoded or previewed in Version 2. Attachment type, name, and approximate encoded size are displayed.
- Full-backup search across every contact is not included. Conversation search scans the selected contact's indexed messages.

## Remaining release gates

Before publishing the GitHub release, test copies of real SMS Backup & Restore files, especially:

1. the oldest available backup,
2. a current SMS-only backup,
3. a backup containing MMS,
4. the largest available backup,
5. local and international number variants from the same contact,
6. Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, and Edge.

Update screenshots and repository URLs, complete the remaining browser and MMS checks where possible, then create the `v2.0.0` tag. The final release source is prepared for the public repository at `https://github.com/petrk94/smsviewer`.

## Recommended release classification

Version 2.0.0 is suitable as a major release candidate after the real-file verification above. The storage model, import pipeline, number normalization, interface, and bundled dependency strategy are sufficiently different from Version 1 to justify a major version.
